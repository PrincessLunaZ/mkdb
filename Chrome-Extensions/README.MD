These samples are Google Chrome extensions. This "README" will be more detailed because I haven't seen other malware repositories with this type of sample yet. 

If you have no clue how to install one of the chrome extensions, here a step-by-step guide on how to install one:

### Step 1

Have a Virtual Machine ready with Google Chrome. Download the Chrome Extension you want.

### Step 2

Extract (unzip) the .zip file you downloaded.

### Step 3

If you have Chrome Version 68 or under, use the .CRX File. If you have a version newer than that (pretty likely) than choose the "Source" folder.

Here are two methods to install these Chrome extensions.

## "Source" Folder

1: Make sure your .Zip file with the Chrome extension is saved to your preferable place.

2: Go to Extensions page in Chrome that should be in in chrome://extensions/ .

3: Enable Developer Mode if it isn't enabled already.

4: Go to the top and click "Load Unpacked."

5: Chrome will prompt you for a folder. Select the "Source" Folder you dragged to the desktop.

If Chrome says that the extension is missing a manifest file, Try to click 'Load Unpacked' again.

6: The Chrome extension should be installed.

## "CRX" Folder

1: Have Chrome version 68 or under ready.

2: Follow steps 1 & 2 from the Source Folder Guide.

3: Go to the CRX Folder, and drag and drop the .CRX file you have.

4: It should install.

### Step 4

It should have successfully installed. If it did, enjoy your infested Chrome!

# Please note that the manifest versions on most of these extensions are outdated, so Chrome may/may not accept them. You can install an older version of Google Chrome to circumvent this issue.
